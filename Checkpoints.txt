Project Initialization
Project Setup

 Choose a name for the project.
 Set up a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
 Initialize with a README.md describing project goals and technologies.
 Configure .gitignore for Java and Spring Boot projects.
Microservices Initial Structure

 Create core microservices (user-service, task-service, expense-service).
 Configure each microservice with Spring Boot initializer.
 Define dependencies in pom.xml or build.gradle for each service (REST, Actuator, JPA, Security, etc.).
 Set up multi-module project structure if you want a single repository for all services.
Stage 1: Core APIs and Database
Database Design and Integration

 Define data models for each service (e.g., User, Task, Expense).
 Set up databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
 Configure JPA/Hibernate and repository layer in each service.
 Establish foreign key relationships and indexing for optimization.
Create REST APIs

 Define API endpoints for each microservice (e.g., CRUD for tasks and expenses).
 Use appropriate HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
 Set up basic controllers, services, and repositories for each service.
 Test endpoints using Postman or Swagger.
Implement Spring Actuator

 Enable Spring Actuator for monitoring.
 Configure endpoints like /health, /metrics, etc.
 Secure sensitive Actuator endpoints.
Checkpoints

 APIs are functioning and respond with proper status codes.
 Database is correctly populated and maintains relationships.
 Actuator is monitoring basic service metrics.
Stage 2: Authentication and Security
OAuth2/JWT Setup

 Configure Spring Security for OAuth2 and JWT.
 Set up an authentication service to issue JWT tokens.
 Implement login, signup, and token refresh endpoints.
 Protect endpoints with JWT authentication.
CSRF Protection

 Enable CSRF protection in Spring Security for sensitive actions.
 Exclude CSRF for non-browser (API) clients if needed.
Method-Level Security

 Use @PreAuthorize and @Secured annotations to restrict access.
 Define role-based access for different service methods.
Checkpoints

 Authentication and authorization are working with JWT tokens.
 Roles and access restrictions are effective.
Stage 3: Inter-Service Communication and Messaging
Service Registry and API Gateway

 Set up a service registry (e.g., Eureka) for service discovery.
 Configure an API gateway (e.g., Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway) to route requests.
RabbitMQ Integration

 Install RabbitMQ and configure it in each microservice.
 Use RabbitMQ to send notifications between services.
 Test asynchronous message handling in microservices.
Checkpoints

 Services register correctly with Eureka.
 Inter-service communication is working through the API gateway.
 RabbitMQ queues are processing messages as expected.
Stage 4: Notifications and Reports
Email Integration

 Configure email properties for notifications and OTPs.
 Implement email templates and logic in user-service for sending emails.
Firebase Push Notifications

 Set up Firebase and configure FCM keys in the project.
 Create a service for sending push notifications to users.
iText PDF Generation

 Implement PDF generation for statistics or reports.
 Configure endpoints to allow downloading of generated PDFs.
Checkpoints

 Emails are being sent and received successfully.
 Push notifications are reaching registered devices.
 PDFs are generated with correct data and format.
Stage 5: Dashboard and Analytics
Apache Superset Setup

 Dockerize Apache Superset and integrate it with your database.
 Create visualizations and dashboards for expense data.
 Embed or link Superset dashboards in the application.
SQL Query Optimization

 Analyze and optimize SQL queries using indexes and query profiling.
 Implement pagination and caching for high-demand queries.
Checkpoints

 Superset dashboard displays accurate, real-time data.
 Database queries are optimized for performance.
Stage 6: Testing, Documentation, and Validation
Testing (JUnit 5 / Mockito)

 Write unit tests for controllers, services, and repositories.
 Mock dependencies with Mockito.
 Achieve at least 80% test coverage.
Swagger API Documentation

 Integrate Swagger and document all APIs.
 Verify Swagger displays all endpoints and models accurately.
Validation and Exception Handling

 Implement bean validation for request payloads.
 Centralize exception handling with @ControllerAdvice.
Checkpoints

 Tests run successfully and coverage requirements are met.
 Swagger documentation is comprehensive and accessible.
 Validation and error handling work as expected.
Stage 7: Deployment and Containerization
Docker Containerization

 Dockerize each service, including Superset and RabbitMQ.
 Create Docker Compose configurations for running the full stack locally.
CI/CD Pipeline Setup

 Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar.
 Automate builds, tests, and deployments with the pipeline.
 Implement quality checks like linting and vulnerability scanning.
Logging with ELK Stack

 Set up an ELK stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
 Integrate microservices to push logs to ELK for monitoring and troubleshooting.
Checkpoints

 Docker containers for all services are running correctly.
 CI/CD pipeline successfully builds, tests, and deploys.
 Logs are visible in Kibana and searchable.
Final Checklist: Verification and Optimization
 Run end-to-end tests to ensure all services work together.
 Verify response times, database performance, and API gateway routing.
 Monitor services in real-time with Actuator and ELK Stack.
 Optimize resource allocation and configurations as needed.
